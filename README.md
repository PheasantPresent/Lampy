Lampy. Duh.


What I fed to ChatGPT:
Create embed code for 3 modules on the same website:

Module 1 (Titled "INPUT EMAIL")
Free form text box
400 pixels wide
Only accepts following entries as OK (separated by commas): chavalah.levy@gmail.com, c.havalahlevy@gmail.com

Module 2 (Titled "INPUT TEXT")
Free form text box
350 pixels wide
250 pixels tall
Only accepts entries that are at least 3 characters long
Only accepts entries that less than 500 characters
Submit Buttons has text that says "Submit to Lampy"
Text from this box is saved in local storage where it can be displayed later in Module 3

Module 3 (Titled "DISPLAY TEXT")
Displays 1 entry of text from Module 2 at a time
Display a randomized new entry at each refresh until there are no new entries
When there are no new entries, start displaying previously displayed entries
Auto-Refresh to new text entry from Module 2 Every 24 hours at 3AM Pacific Time
Text is Font Helvetica
Text is size 60
if there are no entries to display, display text "null"
